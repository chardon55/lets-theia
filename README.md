## Eclipse Theia™️ vs Let's Theia?

The relationship between Eclipse Theia and Let's Theia
is basically like Code-OSS and VSCodium.

Furthermore, Eclipse Theia is an IDE framework based on
Code-OSS, also there is already a thing named
Theia Blueprint but it is "not a production-ready IDE". Let's Theia
therefore comes to make it as if it is an independent IDE.
