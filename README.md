# Let's Theia

A minimal [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) distribution.

Let's Theia follows most of the instruction and
implementation of the [Theia Blueprint](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-blueprint) template
to emit a usable Eclipse Theia IDE.

**Let's Theia is currently under early development. Use it at your own risk.**

## Eclipse Theia™ vs Let's Theia?

The relationship between Eclipse Theia and Let's Theia
is basically like Code-OSS and VSCodium.

Furthermore, Eclipse Theia is an IDE framework based on
Code-OSS. Although there is already a thing named
Theia Blueprint, it is "not a production-ready IDE".
Let's Theia therefore comes to make it as if it is an complete IDE.
